README for Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot 🚗🤖

🌟 Introduction

This project demonstrates the creation of an Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot using an Arduino. It combines the functionality of an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, a servo motor for scanning the surroundings, and DC motors for movement control. The robot can autonomously detect obstacles in its path, decide the best direction to turn, and navigate smoothly without user intervention.

Designed for beginners and robotics enthusiasts, this project is ideal for those looking to explore robotics, Arduino programming, and the fundamentals of obstacle avoidance. The robot is compact, easy to assemble, and can be used for various applications such as navigation challenges and robotics competitions.

✅ Features

1. Obstacle Detection 🛑:
The ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance to obstacles and triggers evasive actions if necessary.


2. Dynamic Path Scanning 🔄:
The servo motor rotates left and right, scanning the environment to identify the clearer path for movement.


3. Smooth Movement Control ⚙:
The robot uses DC motors to move forward, stop, or turn left/right based on the sensor’s input.


4. Autonomous Navigation 🤖:
The robot operates independently, avoiding obstacles and resuming its path without manual control.


5. Customizable Threshold 🎛:
Adjust the obstacle detection distance to fit different operating environments or sensitivity requirements.


6. Compact and Portable 🧳:
The robot is small enough to operate in tight spaces while still being powerful enough to handle navigation tasks.


7. Educational Value 📘:
A perfect project for students, hobbyists, and educators looking to teach or learn about robotics and automation.

🚀 How It Works

1. Distance Measurement 📏: The ultrasonic sensor sends out sound waves. It calculates the time taken for the waves to bounce back and determines the distance to obstacles.



2. Obstacle Detection 🚨: If the detected distance is less than the threshold (default: 15 cm), the robot stops and prepares for obstacle avoidance.



3. Environment Scanning 🌍: The servo motor rotates to the left and right, measuring distances in both directions to find the clearest path.



4. Decision Making 🧠: Based on the scanning results, the robot decides which direction is clearer and turns accordingly.



5. Movement Resumption 🛤: After turning, the robot resumes forward movement and continues its navigation.

💻 Software Implementation

Core Functions:

1. getDistance() 📏: Measures the distance to the nearest obstacle using the ultrasonic sensor.



2. moveForward() ➡: Activates both DC motors to move the robot forward.



3. stopMotors() 🛑: Stops all motor activity, halting the robot.



4. turnLeft() ↩: Activates the left motor to turn the robot to the left.



5. turnRight() ↪: Activates the right motor to turn the robot to the right.



6. avoidObstacle() 🧭: Uses the servo motor to scan left and right, compares the distances, and determines the best path for navigation.




Customization Options:

The obstacle detection threshold can be modified:

if (distance <= 15) {  
    // Change 15 to your preferred threshold in centimeters.  
}

Servo angles can be fine-tuned to improve scanning precision.
